    New web browser.  Backend team.  Implement navigation & history system.
    
    Simplest one: stack of URLs.  Would support navigating 'back'.
    Forward?  Stack forward direction as well, the current page browser is on 
    sits between those two stacks.
    
    
    
    Later on in question, use a prefix tree or something.
    
    
    
    Want an API for UI team to call for page navigation.
    
    When opening a new browser window, goes to 'home' page.  So we have two empty 
    stacks, with current URL string set to the 'home' page stored in browser settings.
    
    Maybe the API team provides that home URL when calling the navigator.  We will set to Amperity web page.
