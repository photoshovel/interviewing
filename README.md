# interviewing
This was a take-home interview problem utilizing Spring Boot I completed in the Fall of 2022.
Some test cases haven't been entirely fleshed-out, but the logic for the problem is all there.
I also added-on some niceties that weren't included in the initial problem request.

Using this as an example of recent code of mine as I don't have anything I can share publicly that has been written in recent history.

I had not used Java or Spring since around 2011 and was pleasantly surprised I was able to crank this solution out pretty quickly.  
Apparently things have not changed all that much in the World of Enterprise Java since then.
